terraform plan -out demo-k8s-gke.state
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  + google_container_cluster.gcp_kubernetes
      id:                                    <computed>
      additional_zones.#:                    "2"

This plan was saved to: demo-k8s-gke.state

To perform exactly these actions, run the following command to apply:
    terraform apply "demo-k8s-gke.state"


```

### terraform apply "demo-k8s-gke.state"

```
terraform apply
